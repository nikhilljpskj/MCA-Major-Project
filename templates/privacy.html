<h1 style="color: #45b6fe">Privacy Policy</h1><br><br><br>






<h4 style="color: #ffffff">Effective 15 July 2021</h4><br><br>

<h5 style="color: #ffffff">Smart Summarization, respects and values its Users’ privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information Smart Summarization collects from Users when they visit Smart Summarization (the “Website”), how Smart Summarization uses that information, and under what circumstances Smart Summarization may or does disclose that information. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Smart Summarization Terms of Service also available on the Website.</h5><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Changes to Privacy Policies.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Smart Summarization's Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, so Smart Summarization suggests that User reviews the current Privacy Policy at the start of each visit to the Website. Unless Smart Summarization clearly expresses otherwise, Smart Summarization will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which User Information, as defined below, was collected, and User accepts and agrees to Smart Summarization practices as described herein. USER IS HEREBY ADVISED THAT USER’S CONTINUED USE OF THE WEBSITE CONSTITUTES USER’S ACCEPTANCE OF ANY AMENDMENTS TO AND THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE WEBSITE’S TERMS OF SERVICE.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Information Smart Summarization Collects.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">When User uses the Website, Smart Summarization may receive and collect certain information. The information that Smart Summarization may receive and collect depends on what User does when it visits the Website.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Automatically Collected Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from User when User visits the Website. This information may include some or all of the following items: (i) the name of the domain and host from which User accesses the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer User is using and the IP address of User’s Internet Service Provider; (ii) the type and version of Internet browser software User uses and its operating system; (iii) the date and time User accesses the Website, the length of User’s stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that User accesses while visiting the site; (iv) the Internet address of the website from which User linked directly to the Website, and if applicable, the search engine that referred User and any search strings or phrases that User entered into the search engine to find the Website; and (v) demographic information concerning the country of origin of User’s computer and the language(s) used by it. Smart Summarization uses this information to monitor the usage of the Website, assess its performance, ensure technological compatibility with Users’ computers, and understand the relative importance of the information provided on the Website. Smart Summarization may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on Users’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Information Collected via Cookies.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">“Cookies” are small files or records that are placed on User’s computer to distinguish User from other visitors to the Website. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect or track information about User’s activities while using the Website. Generally, a Cookie may enable a website owner to track how a visitor navigates through the website and the areas in which visitors show interest. This is analogous to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors but does not identify individuals. Information gathered in this fashion may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the Website, and the website visited just before and just after a visit to the Website. Cookies can be set to expire: (i) on a specified date; (ii) after a specific period of time; (iii) when a transaction has been completed; or (iv) when a User turns off his/her Internet browser. A Cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie whereas Cookies which expire based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies. The Website may use both “session cookies” and “permanent cookies,” as well as session tracking technology (e.g., InspectLet) which analyzes user behavior when on the Website. Internet browsers are typically set to accept Cookies by default. User can choose to have its browser warn User every time a Cookie is being sent to User or User can turn off Cookie placements. If User refuses Cookies, there may be parts of the Website which may not function properly.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Information User May Actively Submit Through the Website.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">For some of the browsing on the Website, Smart Summarization neither requires nor collects “User Information,” which is information communicated by User to Smart Summarization generally for use by Smart Summarization in contacting User, e.g., User’s name and email address. User can browse the Website and take as much time as User wants to review the Website without having to submit such User Information. In the following instances, however and without limitation, User will be required to submit User Information: (i) when User wants to contact Smart Summarization via email or Website contact forms; (ii) when User registers an account on the Website; or (iii) as necessary to process transactions entered into via the Website. E-mail or other forms of electronic communication, including contact form submission, are inherently not a secure and/or confidential means of communication. Information that is provided to Smart Summarization as a “Submission,” as that term is used in the Website Terms of Services, is not “User Information” as that term is used in this Privacy Policy, and Smart Summarization may handle Submission information in its sole discretion.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Personal Information About Children.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">The Website is targeted primarily for use by adults. Smart Summarization does not target or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, Smart Summarization does not knowingly collect age identifying information, nor does Smart Summarization knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 years. HOWEVER, Smart Summarization HEREBY ADVISES ALL VISITORS TO THE WEBSITE UNDER THE AGE OF 13 NOT TO DISCLOSE OR PROVIDE ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE. In the event that Smart Summarization discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to Smart Summarization, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online for more information about this Act. Smart Summarization will delete the child’s personally identifiable information from Smart Summarization's files to the extent possible.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">E-Mail Communication.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">When User sends an email to Smart Summarization or provides User’s email address to Smart Summarization, User is communicating with Smart Summarization electronically and consents to receive communication from Smart Summarization electronically. Smart Summarization may retain the content of such email(s), User’s email address, and Smart Summarization response(s) in order to further service User’s needs. Smart Summarization may use the data that User provides to send User email or correspondence via other means.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">How Smart Summarization Uses and Shares User Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Smart Summarization may use User Information that User actively submits to better assist User when User visits or contact Smart Summarization again and to send User special offers which may be of interest to User. Smart Summarization may do this by general marketing communications for the Website or related services, including by e-mail, (collectively, “Marketing Communications”). Unless User “opts-out” through opportunities available to User through Smart Summarization's Marketing Communications, Smart Summarization may send User Marketing Communications. User may also “opt-out” of future Marketing Communications by following the instructions provided in this Privacy Policy under the “Access to and Managing User Information” section of this Privacy Policy. Except where Smart Summarization otherwise obtains User’s express permission, Smart Summarization may share User Information with third-parties only under the limited circumstances stated below:

Information is subject to disclosure in response to judicial or other governmental subpoenas, warrants, and court orders served on Smart Summarization in accordance with their terms, as otherwise required by applicable law, or in response to requests by law enforcement.

Information is subject to disclosure to protect Smart Summarization's rights or property, protect its legitimate business interests, to enforce the provisions of Smart Summarization's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, and/or to prevent harm to User or others.

Information may be disclosed to: (i) carefully selected third-party service providers so that they may provide services to User; (ii) provide customer service; (iii) send or email Marketing Communications; (iv) maintain Smart Summarization’s promotions, database, and other programs; (v) monitor the activity of the Website; (vi) conduct surveys; and (vii) process transactions.

Information may be disclosed and transferred if Smart Summarization or its business is sold or offered for sale to another company or person(s), if a petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Laws is filed by or against us, or if Smart Summarization becomes subject to an order of appointment of a trustee or receiver.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Linking to Third-Party Websites.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">When User click on links on the Website that take User to third-party websites, User may be subject to the third-party website’s privacy policies. While Smart Summarization supports the protection of privacy on the Internet, Smart Summarization cannot be responsible for the actions of any third-party websites. Smart Summarization encourages User to read the posted privacy policies of any and every website User visits, whether User is linking from the Website or browsing on its own.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Access to and Managing User Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Smart Summarization believes it is important for User to be able to: (i) find out what Information User has provided to Smart Summarization through the Website; (ii) update User Information; and (iii) “opt out” of receiving future Smart Summarization Communications. To inquire about User Information, update User Information, or “opt” out of receiving future Smart Summarization Communications, User may do one of the following:

Select the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” option(s) contained with Smart Summarization’s emails; or
Send an e-mail with User’s request and current contact information to Smart Summarizationsummarizer@gmail.com. If User sends an e-mail request, User should include its full name and email address, and indicate the specific nature of User’s request. If User wants to “opt in” or “opt out” of receiving Smart Summarization communications, specifically what type of Smart Summarization communication (e.g., e-mail) User wishes to receive or stop receiving. This will ensure Smart Summarization identifies User correctly in Smart Summarization’s systems and accurately processes User’s request. Smart Summarization will take appropriate steps to implement User’s request, but due to production, mailing and system timelines, it may take up to ten (10) business days for e-mails. Until that change takes effect, User may still receive or not receive Smart Summarization Communications. “Opting-out” of Smart Summarization Communications may prevent Smart Summarization from providing certain services which may be necessary for User’s use of the Website or services provided thereon.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">What User Needs to Do to Protect its Information.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">User has several options when deciding how it can best protect User Information. One option is simply not to volunteer it. As stated above, this approach would allow User to still visit the Website, although it will prevent User, for example, from utilizing services or materials provided via the Website or providing Smart Summarization with User’s comments or questions relating to the Website. The Federal Trade Commission’s website, www.ftc.gov, also offers useful information about how to protect personally identifiable information provided to a website.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">What to Do About Suspected Violations of This Privacy Statement.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">If at any time User believes that Smart Summarization has not adhered to the policies and principles set forth in this Privacy Statement, please notify Smart Summarization using the contact information provided in Section 7(b). Smart Summarization will make all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly respond to such concerns.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Do-Not-Track.</h4>
<p style="color: #ffffff">To the extent do-not-track implementations from User’s browser(s) prevent or impede the delivery of services provided through Smart Summarization.com, those do-not-track implementations are not honored.</p><br>

<h4 style="color: #45b6fe">Questions or Comments.</h4><br>
<p style="color: #ffffff">If User have any questions or comments concerning Smart Summarization’s Privacy Policy, please contact Smart Summarization using the information provided in Section 7(b).</p><br>
